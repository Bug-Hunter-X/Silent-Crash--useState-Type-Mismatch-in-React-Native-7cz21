This error occurs when using the useState hook in React Native and attempting to update the state with a value that is not the same type as the initial state value.  For example, if the initial state is a number, and you attempt to update it with a string, the app will crash silently without any helpful error message in the console. This is particularly frustrating because debugging becomes difficult due to the lack of specific error information. Consider the following snippet:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initial state is a number

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    setCount('1'); // Attempting to update with a string
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={handleIncrement} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
